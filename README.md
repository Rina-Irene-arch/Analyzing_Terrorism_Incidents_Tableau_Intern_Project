# Analyzing Terrorism Incidents (Jan 2021 - Jun 2021)

### Background 

The Global [Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/) is an open-source database containing information on over 200,000 terrorist incidents worldwide from 1970 through 2020, with plans for annual updates. 
Statistical information contained in the GTD is based on reports from a variety of open media sources.
The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) provides public access to GTD online to increase understanding of terrorist violence and help defeat it.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to explore and visualize terrorism incident data from January 2021 to June 2021 using Tableau, create interactive dashboard to analyze the patterns and trends of these incidents across different countries and regions, draw conclusions based on the findings and provide actionable recommendations.

### Dataset Description

The [dataset](globalterrorismdb_2021Jan-June_1222dist.xlsx) covering incidents from January to June 2021. It contains detailed information on each terrorist incident that occurred during this period. 
The dataset is quite extensive, containing 135 columns related to various aspects of terrorist incidents (see data set [info](globalterrorismdb_2021Jan-June_1222dist.ipynb))
